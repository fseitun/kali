# ADR 0005: Deterministic narration and transcript fast path before LLM

## Status

Accepted. Amended by [ADR 0006](0006-remove-ask-riddle-primitive.md): the riddle bank landed, so the `ASK_RIDDLE` carve-out in Decision 1 is withdrawn and the primitive is gone.

## Context

Kali’s voice loop paid an LLM round-trip for work the orchestrator already knows how to do: fork prompts, most special-square landing copy, and rigid user replies (digits for pending rolls, option indices for riddles, pure-digit movement rolls, “help”-style queries). That added latency, cost, and variance without strengthening authority—the orchestrator still had to validate every primitive.

Animal encounters (riddle trivia generation and grading policy) were still interpreter-assisted when this was written; the follow-up sketched in [`docs/plans/riddle-bank-llm-removal.md`](../plans/riddle-bank-llm-removal.md) has since landed (ADR 0006).

## Decision

1. **Orchestrator-owned narration (no nested LLM)** — Fork enforcement and **non-animal** square landings speak via `ISpeechService` and i18n (`DecisionPointEnforcer`, `BoardEffectsHandler`). Do not route those prompts through `processTranscript` / `getActions` as synthetic `[SYSTEM:…]` transcripts. ~~Animal encounter landings may still invoke the interpreter for `ASK_RIDDLE` + `NARRATE` until the riddle-bank plan lands.~~ The bank landed; animal landings are deterministic too (ADR 0006).

2. **Transcript fast path** — Before calling `getActions`, attempt pattern-based mapping to the same `PrimitiveAction[]` shape the model would return (`tryFastPathTranscript` in [`src/orchestrator/transcript-fast-path.ts`](../../src/orchestrator/transcript-fast-path.ts)). Fast-path output must run through the **same** validation and execution pipeline as LLM output—no duplicate game logic in the app layer.

3. **Tighter interpreter calls where the LLM remains** — Lower temperature and JSON-oriented response shaping for `getActions` where supported; add a single machine-owned **interpretation contract** line in state context when helpful so the model does not contradict the CPU’s expected primitive for the current pending phase.

## Consequences

- **Tests** should assert **TTS** and **game state** for deterministic paths, building expected strings from i18n (`t(…)`) where needed—not mock LLM narration strings. Counting `getActions` invocations is brittle when nested interpreter calls are removed; prefer behavioral assertions unless the test explicitly targets call budgeting.
- **Ambiguous digits** — Bare numbers (e.g. `"3"`) may be consumed by the fast path as a riddle index or encounter roll. Tests that require the LLM path (e.g. `lastBotUtterance` context) should use transcripts that do not match the fast path (e.g. spelled-out numbers in the relevant locale) or set pending state so the fast path does not apply.
- **Prompt size** — Extra contract/context lines can grow bundled prompt size; system-prompt size guards in tests may need occasional adjustment, or contract text can stay in dynamic context only if we want a stable `SYSTEM_PROMPT` cap.
- **Types** — Runtime predicates such as `isPendingRollKind` do not narrow TypeScript unions; after such checks, use an explicit pending-roll union type or cast when calling helpers like `getPendingRollSpec`.
