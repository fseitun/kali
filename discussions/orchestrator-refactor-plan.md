# Orchestrator Refactor Plan - Extract Subsystems

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the extraction of three subsystems from the monolithic orchestrator class to improve maintainability, testability, and code clarity. The orchestrator will be reduced from 650 lines to approximately 250 lines by extracting turn management, board effects, and decision point enforcement into separate modules.

## Current State Analysis

### File Metrics
- **File:** `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`
- **Current Size:** 650 lines
- **Current Responsibilities:** 7 distinct concerns

### Identified Responsibilities
1. Core orchestration loop (LLM request/response cycle)
2. Action validation and execution dispatch
3. Turn management (auto-advance, ownership validation, pending decisions)
4. Board effects (snakes/ladders auto-application, square effect triggers)
5. Decision point enforcement (blocking movement until decisions are made)
6. Processing lock management
7. State coordination

### The Problem

The orchestrator has grown beyond its core responsibility of coordinating the LLM-primitive action cycle. Turn management, board effects, and decision points are distinct subsystems that deserve their own modules for:
- **Testability:** Each can be unit tested in isolation
- **Maintainability:** Easier to locate and modify specific logic
- **Extensibility:** Game-specific logic can be swapped or extended
- **Clarity:** Reduced cognitive load when reading code

## Architecture Goals

### Before State
```
Orchestrator (650 lines)
├── Core orchestration
├── Turn management
├── Board effects
├── Decision enforcement
├── Action execution
└── Lock management
```

### After State
```
Orchestrator (≈250 lines)
├── Core orchestration
├── Action execution dispatch
└── Module coordination

TurnManager (≈120 lines)
├── Pending decision checks
├── Turn advancement
└── Turn ownership validation

BoardEffectsHandler (≈140 lines)
├── Board move application (snakes/ladders)
└── Square effect triggers

DecisionPointEnforcer (≈70 lines)
└── Decision requirement enforcement
```

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Orchestrator Authority Preserved**
   - Orchestrator remains the sole entry point for state mutations
   - Extracted modules receive StateManager but only orchestrator coordinates overall flow
   - All modules respect the "orchestrator is CPU" architecture

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - All dependencies passed via constructor
   - Makes dependencies explicit and visible
   - Enables easy mocking for testing

3. **No Behavioral Changes**
   - This is a pure structural refactor
   - Zero changes to game logic or user-facing behavior
   - All existing functionality must continue working identically

4. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each module handles one cohesive concern
   - Clear boundaries between modules
   - Minimal coupling between modules

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Document Preparation ✓

**Create this document:** `discussions/orchestrator-refactor-plan.md`
- Provides standalone reference for the refactor
- Follows pattern of other analysis documents

**Update roadmap:** `discussions/prioritized-roadmap.md`
- Update item #18 status to reference this plan
- Ensures discoverability

### Phase 1: Extract TurnManager

**Target File:** `src/orchestrator/turn-manager.ts` (~120 lines)

**Methods to Extract:**

1. **`hasPendingDecisions(): boolean`** (lines 192-236)
   - Checks if current player is at a decision point
   - Validates if required field is filled
   - Returns true if decision is pending, false otherwise
   - Used to block turn advancement

2. **`advanceTurn(): Promise<{playerId, name, position} | null>`** (lines 243-307)
   - Advances to next player in turn order
   - Blocks if square effect being processed
   - Blocks if current player has pending decisions
   - Blocks if game has winner or not in PLAYING phase
   - Updates `game.turn` state
   - Returns next player info for TTS announcement

3. **`assertPlayerTurnOwnership(path: string): Promise<void>`** (lines 517-542)
   - Validates that state mutations target current turn's player
   - Throws error if mutation targets wrong player
   - Safety check for turn-based game rules

**Interface Design:**
```typescript
import { StateManager } from '../state-manager'
import { SpeechService } from '../services/speech-service'
import { GameState, GamePhase } from './types'

/**
 * Manages turn-based gameplay mechanics.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Check if current player has pending decisions
 * - Advance turn to next player with appropriate blocking
 * - Validate turn ownership for state mutations
 */
export class TurnManager {
  constructor(
    private stateManager: StateManager,
    private speechService: SpeechService
  ) {}

  /**
   * Checks if the current player has pending decisions at their position.
   * @returns true if there are unresolved decisions, false otherwise
   */
  hasPendingDecisions(): boolean

  /**
   * Advances to the next player's turn with automatic blocking.
   * Blocks advancement if:
   * - Square effect is being processed
   * - Current player has pending decisions
   * - Game has a winner
   * - Game is not in PLAYING phase
   *
   * @returns Next player info or null if unable to advance
   */
  async advanceTurn(): Promise<{ playerId: string; name: string; position: number } | null>

  /**
   * Validates that a state mutation targets the current turn's player.
   * @param path - State path being mutated (e.g., "players.p1.position")
   * @throws Error if mutation targets wrong player
   */
  async assertPlayerTurnOwnership(path: string): Promise<void>
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- **StateManager:** Read/write game state (turn, playerOrder, players, decisionPoints)
- **SpeechService:** Announce next player's turn via TTS

**Key Considerations:**
- Must receive `isProcessingSquareEffect` flag from orchestrator
- Option 1: Pass as parameter to `advanceTurn(isProcessingEffect: boolean)`
- Option 2: Make it a separate method `setProcessingEffect(value: boolean)`
- **Decision:** Pass as parameter for clarity and simplicity

### Phase 2: Extract BoardEffectsHandler

**Target File:** `src/orchestrator/board-effects-handler.ts` (~140 lines)

**Methods to Extract:**

1. **`checkAndApplyBoardMoves(path: string): Promise<void>`** (lines 376-402)
   - Checks if mutation is a player position change
   - Reads `board.moves` configuration
   - Auto-applies snakes (destination < position) and ladders (destination > position)
   - Silent automatic application (no LLM involved)
   - **Game-specific logic:** Currently hard-coded for Snakes & Ladders / Kalimba

2. **`checkAndApplySquareEffects(path: string, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<void>`** (lines 404-452)
   - Checks if mutation is a player position change
   - Reads `board.squares` configuration
   - If square has effect data, injects synthetic LLM transcript
   - Triggers LLM to process square effect (encounters, items, hazards)
   - Sets `isProcessingSquareEffect` flag during processing
   - **Game-specific logic:** Currently hard-coded for Kalimba encounters

**Interface Design:**
```typescript
import { StateManager } from '../state-manager'
import { ExecutionContext } from './types'

/**
 * Handles automatic board mechanics and square-based effects.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Auto-apply board moves (snakes, ladders, portals)
 * - Trigger square-specific effects via LLM processing
 *
 * Note: Currently contains game-specific logic for Snakes & Ladders and Kalimba.
 * Future work will move this to game config hooks for true game-agnostic orchestrator.
 */
export class BoardEffectsHandler {
  private isProcessingSquareEffect = false

  constructor(
    private stateManager: StateManager,
    private processTranscriptFn: (transcript: string, context: ExecutionContext) => Promise<boolean>
  ) {}

  /**
   * Automatically applies board moves (snakes/ladders) after position changes.
   * Reads board.moves config and silently applies destination changes.
   * @param path - State path that was mutated
   */
  async checkAndApplyBoardMoves(path: string): Promise<void>

  /**
   * Triggers square-specific effects when player lands on special squares.
   * Reads board.squares config and injects LLM processing for effects.
   * @param path - State path that was mutated
   * @param context - Execution context for depth tracking
   */
  async checkAndApplySquareEffects(path: string, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<void>

  /**
   * Checks if currently processing a square effect.
   * Used by turn manager to block turn advancement during effect resolution.
   * @returns true if processing effect, false otherwise
   */
  isProcessingEffect(): boolean
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- **StateManager:** Read board config (moves, squares), apply position changes
- **processTranscriptFn:** Callback to inject synthetic LLM requests for square effects

**Key Considerations:**
- Must track `isProcessingSquareEffect` state internally
- Expose via `isProcessingEffect()` getter for turn manager to check
- `processTranscriptFn` receives bound `processTranscript` method from orchestrator

### Phase 3: Extract DecisionPointEnforcer

**Target File:** `src/orchestrator/decision-point-enforcer.ts` (~70 lines)

**Methods to Extract:**

1. **`enforceDecisionPoints(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<void>`** (lines 454-515)
   - Checks if current player is at a position with a decision point
   - Reads `decisionPoints` array from state
   - Validates if required field is filled on current player
   - If not filled, injects synthetic LLM transcript to prompt decision
   - Prevents movement until decision is made

**Interface Design:**
```typescript
import { StateManager } from '../state-manager'
import { ExecutionContext } from './types'

/**
 * Enforces decision point requirements in game flow.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Check if current player is at a decision point
 * - Verify required fields are filled
 * - Inject prompts to ask player for decisions
 */
export class DecisionPointEnforcer {
  constructor(
    private stateManager: StateManager,
    private processTranscriptFn: (transcript: string, context: ExecutionContext) => Promise<boolean>
  ) {}

  /**
   * Enforces decision points for current player.
   * If player is at a decision point and hasn't filled required field,
   * injects a prompt to ask for the decision.
   *
   * @param context - Execution context for depth tracking
   */
  async enforceDecisionPoints(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<void>
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- **StateManager:** Read decision points config and player state
- **processTranscriptFn:** Callback to inject prompts asking for decisions

**Key Considerations:**
- Checks depth limit before injecting prompts (avoid infinite recursion)
- Only processes if `context.depth < context.maxDepth - 1`

### Phase 4: Update Orchestrator Integration

**Changes to `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`:**

**1. Add imports:**
```typescript
import { TurnManager } from './turn-manager'
import { BoardEffectsHandler } from './board-effects-handler'
import { DecisionPointEnforcer } from './decision-point-enforcer'
```

**2. Add private fields:**
```typescript
export class Orchestrator {
  private turnManager: TurnManager
  private boardEffectsHandler: BoardEffectsHandler
  private decisionPointEnforcer: DecisionPointEnforcer
  private actionHandlers: Map<string, ActionHandler> = new Map()
  private isProcessing = false
  private initialState: GameState
  // Remove: private isProcessingSquareEffect = false (moved to BoardEffectsHandler)
```

**3. Update constructor:**
```typescript
constructor(
  private llmClient: LLMClient,
  private stateManager: StateManager,
  private speechService: SpeechService,
  private statusIndicator: StatusIndicator,
  initialState: GameState
) {
  this.initialState = initialState

  // Instantiate subsystems
  this.turnManager = new TurnManager(stateManager, speechService)
  this.boardEffectsHandler = new BoardEffectsHandler(
    stateManager,
    this.processTranscript.bind(this)
  )
  this.decisionPointEnforcer = new DecisionPointEnforcer(
    stateManager,
    this.processTranscript.bind(this)
  )
}
```

**4. Update `isProcessingEffect()` method:**
```typescript
isProcessingEffect(): boolean {
  return this.boardEffectsHandler.isProcessingEffect()
}
```

**5. Update method calls throughout:**

Replace all occurrences:
- `this.hasPendingDecisions()` → `this.turnManager.hasPendingDecisions()`
- `this.advanceTurn()` → `this.turnManager.advanceTurn()`
- `await this.assertPlayerTurnOwnership(primitive.path)` → `await this.turnManager.assertPlayerTurnOwnership(primitive.path)`
- `await this.checkAndApplyBoardMoves(primitive.path)` → `await this.boardEffectsHandler.checkAndApplyBoardMoves(primitive.path)`
- `await this.checkAndApplySquareEffects(primitive.path, context)` → `await this.boardEffectsHandler.checkAndApplySquareEffects(primitive.path, context)`
- `await this.enforceDecisionPoints(context)` → `await this.decisionPointEnforcer.enforceDecisionPoints(context)`

**6. Remove extracted methods:**
- Delete `hasPendingDecisions()` (lines 192-236)
- Delete `advanceTurn()` (lines 243-307)
- Delete `checkAndApplyBoardMoves()` (lines 376-402)
- Delete `checkAndApplySquareEffects()` (lines 404-452)
- Delete `enforceDecisionPoints()` (lines 454-515)
- Delete `assertPlayerTurnOwnership()` (lines 517-542)
- Delete `private isProcessingSquareEffect = false` field

**7. Update validator calls:**

The validator currently receives `this` (orchestrator) to check `isProcessingEffect()`. This continues to work since we've proxied the method.

In `src/orchestrator/validator.ts`, the call is:
```typescript
validateActions(actions, state, this.stateManager, this)
```

This continues to work because orchestrator still exposes `isProcessingEffect()`.

**Expected Result:**
- Orchestrator reduced to ~250 lines
- Focused solely on coordination, validation dispatch, and action execution
- All turn/board/decision logic delegated to specialized modules

## Validation Strategy

### Automated Checks

**Linter:**
```bash
npm run lint
```
- Must pass with zero errors
- Run after each module creation and after integration

**Type Checker:**
```bash
npm run type-check
```
- Must pass with zero errors
- Run after integration is complete

### Manual Testing Checklist

Complete game session testing required to verify no behavioral changes:

1. **Game Setup**
   - [ ] Start application
   - [ ] Complete name collection for 2 players
   - [ ] Verify game transitions to PLAYING phase

2. **Basic Turn Flow**
   - [ ] Player 1 rolls dice
   - [ ] Verify position updates correctly
   - [ ] Verify turn auto-advances to Player 2
   - [ ] Player 2 rolls dice
   - [ ] Verify turn cycles back to Player 1

3. **Board Moves (Snakes & Ladders)**
   - [ ] Land on ladder position
   - [ ] Verify automatic climb (position increases)
   - [ ] Land on snake position
   - [ ] Verify automatic slide (position decreases)

4. **Square Effects (Kalimba Encounters)**
   - [ ] Land on special square (encounter, item, hazard)
   - [ ] Verify effect triggers immediately
   - [ ] Verify LLM narrates effect
   - [ ] Verify turn doesn't advance during effect processing

5. **Decision Points (Kalimba Path Choice)**
   - [ ] Reach decision point square (position 3)
   - [ ] Verify system prompts for path choice
   - [ ] Verify movement blocked until decision made
   - [ ] Make decision
   - [ ] Verify turn advancement now allowed

6. **Full Game Session**
   - [ ] Play complete game to winner
   - [ ] Verify no errors in console
   - [ ] Verify no regressions in any feature

### Performance Validation

**No Slowdown Acceptable:**
- Orchestration loop latency should remain unchanged
- State mutation speed should remain unchanged
- LLM request timing should remain unchanged

**Measurement:**
- Check profiler output before and after refactor
- Compare `orchestrator.total` timing
- Compare `orchestrator.execution` timing

### Success Criteria

All of the following must be true:
- ✅ Orchestrator reduced to ≈250 lines (target: 230-270)
- ✅ TurnManager < 150 lines
- ✅ BoardEffectsHandler < 150 lines
- ✅ DecisionPointEnforcer < 100 lines
- ✅ Zero linter errors
- ✅ Zero type errors
- ✅ All manual tests pass
- ✅ No performance regression
- ✅ Zero behavioral changes

## Benefits

### Improved Testability

**Before:**
- Must mock entire orchestrator to test turn logic
- Tests require LLM client, state manager, speech service setup
- Slow test execution due to orchestrator overhead

**After:**
- Test TurnManager in isolation with just StateManager and SpeechService mocks
- Test BoardEffectsHandler with just StateManager and callback mock
- Fast, focused unit tests for each subsystem
- Integration tests can verify orchestrator coordination

**Example Test:**
```typescript
describe('TurnManager', () => {
  it('should block turn advancement when player has pending decision', () => {
    const stateManager = createMockStateManager({
      game: { turn: 'p1' },
      players: { p1: { position: 3 } },
      decisionPoints: [{ position: 3, requiredField: 'path', prompt: 'Choose path' }]
    })

    const turnManager = new TurnManager(stateManager, mockSpeechService)

    expect(turnManager.hasPendingDecisions()).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

### Better Maintainability

**Smaller Files:**
- Orchestrator: 650 → 250 lines (61% reduction)
- Each subsystem < 150 lines (easy to read in one screen)

**Single Responsibility:**
- TurnManager: Only turn logic
- BoardEffectsHandler: Only board mechanics
- DecisionPointEnforcer: Only decision enforcement
- Orchestrator: Only coordination

**Easier Navigation:**
- Need to modify turn advancement? → `turn-manager.ts`
- Need to add square effect? → `board-effects-handler.ts`
- Need to adjust decision logic? → `decision-point-enforcer.ts`
- Clear, predictable file organization

**Reduced Cognitive Load:**
- Understand one concern at a time
- No mental filtering of unrelated code
- Clear module boundaries

### Enhanced Extensibility

**Game-Specific Turn Rules:**
```typescript
// Future: Per-game turn managers
export class KalimbaTurnManager extends TurnManager {
  // Override with Kalimba-specific turn advancement rules
}

// In orchestrator initialization
this.turnManager = gameConfig.turnManagerClass
  ? new gameConfig.turnManagerClass(stateManager, speechService)
  : new TurnManager(stateManager, speechService)
```

**Board Effects as Plugins:**
```typescript
// Future: Move board effects to game config
{
  "name": "Kalimba",
  "boardEffects": {
    "onPositionChange": [
      { "type": "autoMove", "config": { "moves": {...} } },
      { "type": "squareEffect", "config": { "squares": {...} } }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Decision Point Extensions:**
```typescript
// Future: Complex decision types
export class AdvancedDecisionEnforcer extends DecisionPointEnforcer {
  // Support multi-step decisions, conditional decisions, etc.
}
```

### Clearer Architecture

**Before (Monolithic):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Orchestrator (650 lines)       │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Core orchestration                  │ │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**After (Modular):**
```

│  Core Coordination & Action Execution   │
└────────┬─────────┬──────────┬───────────┘

   │(120 lines)│ │(140 lines)│ │(70 lines) │
   └──────────┘ └────────┘ └────────────┘
```

**Dependency Flow:**
```
Orchestrator
├─→ TurnManager(StateManager, SpeechService)
├─→ BoardEffectsHandler(StateManager, processTranscript)
└─→ DecisionPointEnforcer(StateManager, processTranscript)
```

**Clear Interfaces:**
- All dependencies injected via constructor
- No hidden dependencies
- Easy to understand what each module needs

## Trade-offs & Risks

### More Files to Navigate

**Trade-off:**
- 1 file (650 lines) → 4 files (≈650 lines total)
- Must jump between files to understand full flow

**Mitigation:**
- Clear naming makes files easy to find
- Each file has single, obvious purpose
- JSDoc documentation explains module responsibilities
- IDE navigation (Go to Definition) makes jumping seamless

### Constructor Complexity

**Trade-off:**
- Orchestrator constructor gets longer with module instantiation
- Must pass dependencies through constructor chain

**Mitigation:**
- Constructor complexity is explicit, not hidden
- Dependency injection pattern is standard practice
- Future: Can add DI container if needed (item #17 on roadmap)

### Potential Over-Engineering

**Trade-off:**
- Risk of creating unnecessary abstraction layers
- Simple features might require touching multiple files

**Mitigation:**
- Only extracting when clear benefit exists (650 lines → modules)
- Each module has substantial logic (70-140 lines)
- Not extracting trivial methods or single functions
- Each extraction solves real pain point (testability, maintainability)

### Circular Dependency Risk

**Trade-off:**
- Modules need to call back to orchestrator (`processTranscript`)
- Risk of circular imports if not careful

**Mitigation:**
- Use callback functions instead of module dependencies
- Pass `processTranscript.bind(this)` as function parameter
- Modules don't import Orchestrator class
- Clear one-way dependency flow: Orchestrator → Modules

### Learning Curve for New Contributors

**Trade-off:**
- New contributors must learn module structure
- More files to understand before contributing

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive JSDoc on all public methods
- This document provides architectural overview
- Clear module responsibilities reduce confusion
- Pattern is standard industry practice (separation of concerns)

### Next Steps

This refactor creates the foundation for:

1. **Unit Testing** (Roadmap #12)
   - Can now write focused unit tests for each module
   - TurnManager, BoardEffectsHandler, DecisionPointEnforcer testable in isolation

2. **Game-Agnostic Orchestrator** (Roadmap #13)
   - BoardEffectsHandler logic can be moved to game config
   - Hook system can replace hard-coded board effects

3. **Dependency Injection** (Roadmap #17)
   - Module structure already uses constructor injection
   - DI container would centralize this further

4. **Name Collector Refactor** (Phase 2 of Roadmap #18)
   - Similar extraction pattern for confirmation handlers
   - TimeoutManager utility extraction
