## üî• Critical Priority (High Value / Low-Medium Complexity)

### 1. Error Recovery & Voice Feedback üî•
**Value: 10/10 | Complexity: 4/10 | Ratio: 2.5**

**Problem:** All errors (validation failures, LLM network errors, execution errors) are silently logged with no voice feedback. Unacceptable for voice-only interface.

**Implementation:**
- Add voice narration for all error types with specific, helpful messages
- Validation failures: "I can't do that right now, it's not your turn"
- LLM failures: "Sorry, I didn't catch that. Can you try again?"
- Execution errors: "Something went wrong. Let's try that again"
- Add `ErrorHandler` service with error classification (transient, permanent, critical)
- Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors

**Files:**
- `src/services/error-handler.ts` (new)
- `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`
- `src/llm/GeminiClient.ts`
- `src/llm/OllamaClient.ts`

**Status:** Analysis complete in `discussions/error-recovery-analysis.md` - ready to implement

---

### 2. Eliminate LLM Client Duplication üî•
**Value: 8/10 | Complexity: 3/10 | Ratio: 2.67**

**Problem:** `GeminiClient.ts` and `OllamaClient.ts` share 90% identical code for `extractName()` and `analyzeResponse()` methods.

**Implementation:**
- Create `BaseLLMClient` abstract class with shared methods
- Move `extractName()` and `analyzeResponse()` to base class
- Both clients extend base class and only implement `getActions()`
- Reduces code duplication by ~200 lines

**Files:**
- `src/llm/BaseLLMClient.ts` (new)
- `src/llm/GeminiClient.ts` (refactor)
- `src/llm/OllamaClient.ts` (refactor)

---

### 3. LLM Fallback Strategies üî•
**Value: 9/10 | Complexity: 4/10 | Ratio: 2.25**

**Problem:** Empty array returned on LLM failure, no user feedback or recovery.

**Implementation:**
- Add fallback responses for common commands (roll dice, check position, whose turn)
- Implement retry logic with alternate prompts
- Add voice feedback for LLM errors
- Cache recent successful responses as fallbacks
- Add request deduplication/debouncing

**Files:**
- `src/llm/GeminiClient.ts`
- `src/llm/OllamaClient.ts`
- `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`
- `src/llm/fallback-responses.ts` (new)

---

### 4. State Manager Batching üî•
**Value: 8/10 | Complexity: 4/10 | Ratio: 2.0**

**Problem:** Each `stateManager.set()` call triggers full state clone and IndexedDB write. Performance bottleneck.

**Implementation:**
- Add `beginTransaction()` / `commitTransaction()` methods to batch writes
- Implement debounced state persistence (e.g., 100ms delay)
- Add in-memory cache layer
- Target: < 100ms state write latency (currently can be 200-500ms)

**Files:**
- `src/state-manager.ts`
- `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`

---

## ‚≠ê High Value (Significant Impact / Moderate Complexity)

### 5. Type Safety Improvements ‚≠ê
**Value: 7/10 | Complexity: 4/10 | Ratio: 1.75**

**Problem:** Multiple type assertions with `as unknown as Record<string, unknown>` in validator, unsafe JSON parsing.

**Implementation:**
- Create proper type guards for action validation
- Add JSON parse error handling with safe parsing utilities
- Replace type assertions with type guards
- Add discriminated union types for actions
- Eliminate all `as unknown` casts

**Files:**

- `src/llm/OllamaClient.ts`
- `src/utils/json-parser.ts` (new)
- `src/utils/type-guards.ts` (new)

---

### 6. State Corruption Recovery ‚≠ê
**Value: 8/10 | Complexity: 5/10 | Ratio: 1.6**

**Problem:** No validation or recovery if IndexedDB state becomes corrupted. Can cause silent failures.

**Implementation:**
- Add state schema validation on read (JSON Schema or Zod)
- Implement state migrations for version changes
- Add "safe mode" recovery that resets to last known good state
- Automatic state snapshots before mutations

**Files:**
- `src/state-manager.ts`
- `src/utils/state-validator.ts` (new)
- `src/utils/state-migrations.ts` (new)

---

### 7. User Language Selection at Setup ‚≠ê

**Problem:** Currently hardcoded to Spanish (Argentina). Need runtime language selection.

**Implementation:**
- Voice-activated language selection on first launch
- "Choose your language: Spanish or English" / "Eleg√≠ tu idioma: Espa√±ol o Ingl√©s"
- Store language preference in IndexedDB
- Update `CONFIG.LOCALE` dynamically
- Reload i18n translations
- Update LLM system prompt based on selected language
- Wake word "Kali" works phonetically in both languages

**Files:**
- `src/i18n/index.ts`
- `src/orchestrator/name-collector.ts` (add language selection phase)
- `src/config.ts`
- `src/state-manager.ts` (persist language choice)

**Status:** Currently defaulting to Spanish (Argentina)

---

### 8. Explicit Save/Load Game Feature ‚≠ê
**Value: 8/10 | Complexity: 6/10 | Ratio: 1.33**

**Problem:** App always starts fresh on launch. Users can't resume games explicitly.

**Implementation:**
- Voice commands: "Kali, save this game as [name]", "Kali, load game [name]", "Kali, what games are saved?"
- Implement multiple save slots in IndexedDB
- Add save metadata (timestamp, player names, game type)
- Resume flow with player confirmation ("Alice, you're at position 23, correct?")
- Add SAVE_GAME and LOAD_GAME primitive actions

**Files:**
- `src/save-manager.ts` (new)
- `src/state-manager.ts`
- `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`
- `src/orchestrator/types.ts` (new actions)

**Status:** Planned - future enhancement

---

### 9. LLM Narration Rephrasing ‚≠ê
**Value: 7/10 | Complexity: 5/10 | Ratio: 1.4**

**Problem:** All system messages and i18n strings spoken as-is, making Kali sound robotic and repetitive.

**Implementation:**
- Pass system messages through LLM for natural rephrasing
- Cache rephrased messages to avoid redundant API calls
- Add "personality" to Kali's voice
- Especially important for kids

**Files:**
- `src/services/speech-service.ts`
- `src/llm/GeminiClient.ts` (add rephrasing method)
- `src/i18n/index.ts`

**Status:** Planned in `discussions/llm-narration-rephrasing.md` - ready to implement

---

### 10. Runtime Game Selection ‚≠ê
**Value: 7/10 | Complexity: 5/10 | Ratio: 1.4**

**Problem:** Currently defaulting to Kalimba game. Need runtime game selection.

**Implementation:**
- Voice-activated game selection after language selection
- "Choose a game: Kalimba or Snakes and Ladders"
- Automatically detect available games from `/public/games/`
- Store last played game preference in IndexedDB
- Voice command to switch games: "Kali, change game" (with confirmation)
- Voice command to list games: "Kali, what games can we play?"

**Files:**
- `src/game-loader/game-loader.ts` (add discovery)
- `src/orchestrator/name-collector.ts` (add game selection phase)
- `src/config.ts`
- `src/state-manager.ts`

**Status:** Currently defaulting to Kalimba

---

## üíé Strategic (Long-term Value / Higher Complexity)

### 11. Testing Infrastructure üîßüíé

---

### 12. Game-Agnostic Orchestrator üíé
**Value: 8/10 | Complexity: 7/10 | Ratio: 1.14**

**Problem:** `checkAndApplyBoardMoves` in orchestrator is game-specific (Snakes & Ladders logic). Violates core architecture principle.

**Implementation:**
- Move board move logic to game config via `onStateChange` hooks
- Create `APPLY_BOARD_EFFECT` primitive action
- Remove hard-coded Snakes & Ladders logic from orchestrator
- Enable games to define state transformation hooks in JSON

**Files:**

**Problem:** Users might make mistakes and need to recover from errors. No undo functionality.

**Implementation:**
- Automatic snapshots before every state mutation
- Explicit checkpoints via voice: "Kali, checkpoint" or "Kali, save checkpoint before boss fight"
- Retention policy: Keep last 10 states (FIFO queue)
- Voice-activated rollback: "Kali, undo that", "Kali, undo last 3 actions", "Kali, restore to [checkpoint name]"
- IndexedDB-based storage (async, non-blocking)
- Structure: `{ timestamp, state, action }` for automatic, `{ timestamp, state, label }` for explicit

**Files:**
- `src/history-manager.ts` (new)
- `src/state-manager.ts` (integrate snapshots)
- `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts` (integrate undo)

**Overhead:** <5ms per snapshot, minimal storage

---

### 14. LLM Request Optimization üíé
